# GoPay Merchant Auto Payment

This integration lets okkarhys.com use a self-hosted GoPay Merchant QRIS gateway.
The customer does not upload payment proof when the gateway is active; the order is
marked `paid` after the gateway detects the QRIS payment.

## Money destination

The money goes to the GoPay/QRIS merchant configured in the gateway, not to the
website code. For Okka Rhys, the gateway must be configured with the QRIS static
payload from:

- Merchant: `OKKA RHYS, DIGITAL & KREATIF`
- NMID: `ID1025456495932`
- Terminal label: `A01`

If `QRIS_STRING` or `QRIS_STATIC` belongs to another merchant, the money goes to
that merchant instead.

## Supported gateway adapters

`cv3inx` adapter, recommended for this repo:

- Gateway project: `https://github.com/cv3inx/gobiz-payment`
- Create endpoint: `POST /payment/create`
- Status endpoint: `GET /payment/:trxId`
- Webhook: supported with `X-Signature`

`zaki` adapter:

- Gateway project: `https://github.com/ahmadzakiyox/gopay-api-gateaway`
- Create endpoint: `POST /create-qris`
- Status endpoint: `GET /check-payment`
- Webhook: not required; okkarhys checks status through Supabase Function

Both adapters are unofficial GoPay/GoBiz automation layers. Run them on a VPS or
cPanel Node.js app with persistent storage. Do not run them on sleeping/free
serverless containers because the GoBiz session file can disappear.

## Supabase secrets

Set these in Supabase, not in GitHub:

```bash
supabase secrets set GOPAY_GATEWAY_URL="https://gopay.your-domain.com"
supabase secrets set GOPAY_GATEWAY_API_KEY="replace-with-gateway-api-key"
supabase secrets set GOPAY_GATEWAY_ADAPTER="cv3inx"
supabase secrets set GOPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET="replace-with-long-random-secret"
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="replace-with-service-role-key"
```

For the `zaki` adapter, use:

```bash
supabase secrets set GOPAY_GATEWAY_ADAPTER="zaki"
```

## Functions

Deploy these functions:

```bash
supabase functions deploy gopay-create-payment
supabase functions deploy gopay-payment-status
supabase functions deploy gopay-webhook
```

The `cv3inx` gateway should use this webhook URL:

```text
https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/gopay-webhook
```

The create-payment function also passes that callback URL per transaction.

## Admin setting

In `/admin/settings`, enable:

```text
Aktifkan GoPay Merchant QRIS otomatis
```

Leave it disabled until the gateway health endpoint is stable and Supabase secrets
are set. When disabled, checkout keeps using the manual QRIS fallback.
